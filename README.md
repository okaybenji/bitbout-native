To run bitbout as a native app, follow Electron's Quick Start guide at:
http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start/

For example, save the Electron binary from [its release package](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases) to OS X's Application directory. In Terminal, navigate to your bitbout-native directory and run the following commands:
